# Student_Friendly_CRACanalysis
This contents of this repository aim to help in the use and interpretation of the Wallace Lab pipeline available at https://github.com/ewallace/Ssd1_CRACanalysis_2020 


Ssd1 is an RNA binding protein found in S. Cerevisiae which binds numerous RNA transcripts. To identify RNAs bound by Ssd1 as well as sites of binding, the Wallace lab (University of Edinburgh) utilised CRAC analysis. This is an Illumina short-read protocol that detects RNA cross-linking sites for specific proteins. Further details and the results of this analysis are published at:
Yeast Ssd1 is a non-enzymatic member of the RNase II family with an alternative RNA recognition interface. Rosemary A. Bayne, Uma Jayachandran, Aleksandra Kasprowicz, Stefan Bresson, David Tollervey, Edward W. J. Wallace, and Atlanta G. Cook. Nucleic Acids Research, 2021 doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab615

The CRAC analysis pipeline used in this publication is publicly available at https://github.com/Bexley21/Ssd1_CRACanalysis_2020#ssd1_cracanalysis_2020. This pipeline and the folder contents are well annotated. However, as a newcomer to code and RNA-seq analysis there was information that I found I still needed. This is the purpose of this repository.
